Designed this prototype website for a design expo

Due to the prototype nature of this site, it is not responsive and is best on Chrome. Anything else was considered out of scope for a prototype

Some features:
1. Single Page Application
2. JSON data
3. CSS3 tranformations
4. Dynamic data via JSON/Ajax
5. Pages are JS objects

Most this features are my first go at doing them.
